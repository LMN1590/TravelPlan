We did this on the first day as a priority.\n\nIn all honesty, this castle is probably most impressive looking at a distance from another part of the city. There is nothing overly exciting inside. The cathedral paintings and decor is decent but you could just go to Lincoln Cathedral and probably be more impressed. \n\nThe area is very crowded and due to the steep and cobbled sloped paths, not suitable for prams/pushchairs or those with disabilities. It takes about 1.5 - 2 hours to see and appreciate everything within.\n\nIt seems very well guarded for what is essentially a big church with some cafes and shops around it so fair play to the security/police presence. There is one section of the ‘castle’ with medieval bohemian armour and weapons. This was pretty cool.\n\nOther than that and the views of the city, nothing special but something to tick off if you visit.",
