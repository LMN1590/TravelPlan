# TravelPlan

## Overview

This is a project for a travel guide website that, based on user's query, it can provide famous landmarks that will be of interest to tourists.

## Organization

From the index.html, content in index.jsx will be rendered. File index.jsx's content will be based on the route of the webpage, using React-Router and files in /src/start. Files in /src/start will use components in the components folder.
